    "description": "Welcome! I'm Nathan, a learning web developer with a passion for user interaction. I have been studying Computer Science at the University of New Mexico since 2022 and am pursuing a certification in Full Stack Development on my off time. When I am not studying, I enjoy golf, snowboarding, and developing new projects (be sure to check out some of the things I've done!). Also, I spend time volunteering in the community and help mentor in a local youth group. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, so please reach out if you would like to work together and make something great!",
